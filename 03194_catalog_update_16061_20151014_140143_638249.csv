Speed and precision in a tough magnesium alloy body  with access to over 60 EF lenses and the range of EOS accessories for unlimited creativity.<br/><br/><b>Features</b><br/>-8.2 MP CMOS sensor.<br/>-5fps  30 JPEG image burst.<br/>-2.5"" LCD.<br/>-Picture Style image processing.<br/>-Spot metering & 9-point AF.<br/>-DIGIC II.<br/>-Digital Photo Professional software.<br/>-Magnesium alloy body.<br/>-Compatible with all EF/EF-S lenses and EX Speedlite flashes.<br/>-Connectivity.<br/><br/><b>Designed to inspire. Built to last.</b><br/><br/><b>CMOS sensor</b><br/>An 8.2 Megapixel CMOS sensor provides the sensitivity needed for clean  detailed images with fine colour gradation. Large sensor pixels allow for wide dynamic range and reduced noise at higher ISO speeds. The 22.5 × 15mm sensor size adds an effective 1.6x increase to the focal length of EF lenses  extending reach at the telephoto end.<br/><br/><b>5 fps shooting</b><br/>The camera delivers fast 5 fps shooting for continuous bursts of up to 30 large JPEG images (11 in RAW). A new 3 fps shooting mode provides greater control for variable-speed sequences. <br/><br/><b>Large LCD</b><br/>Illuminated by 6 LEDs  the bright 2.5"" 230K pixel LCD is viewable from 85° in almost all directions.<br/><br/><b>Picture Style</b><br/>Picture Style pre-sets provide easy control over image processing parameters. Each style offers a different colour response - similar to the way film types are changed to achieve different effects. Sharpness  contrast  colour tone and saturation are adjustable within each pre-set.<br/><br/><b>Spot metering</b><br/>Spot metering allows you to base the optimal exposure value on a concentrated spot (3.5%) in the scene - useful in high-contrast scenes where precise metering control is required.<br/><br/><b>High precision 9-point wide-area AF</b><br/>Select from one of nine fixed focusing points across the scene for fast  accurate focusing even with off-centre subjects and 'rule-of-thirds' compositions.<br/><br/><b>DIGIC II</b><br/>DIGIC II renders colours with precision and accuracy. Fast and efficient  DIGIC II prolongs battery life and delivers instant 0.15 second start up time.<br/><br/><b>Digital Photo Professional software</b><br/>The Digital Photo Professional software permits high-speed processing of lossless RAW images.<br/><br/><b>Magnesium alloy body</b><br/>A compact magnesium alloy body provides durability while keeping the camera's weight down to 700 grams.<br/><br/><b>EF lenses and accessories</b><br/>The EOS 30D is compatible with over 60 EF lenses (including the EF-S Series) and all EX Series Speedlite flash units. The E-TTL II flash algorithm passes key shooting data from compatible EF lenses - such as focal length  point of focus and distance information - to the Speedlites for consistently accurate flash exposures. Untethered shooting is possible with the optional Wireless File Transmitter WFT-E1.<br/><br/><b>Connectivity</b><br/>Video Out allows reviewing on a TV screen.

Its one fluorite lens and two UD lenses completely eliminate secondary spectrum. It offers super high image quality with both resolution and contrast higher than ever before. And the image stabilizer that equals about 2 shutter speed steps maximizes the performance of the lens under all photography conditions. Its autofocusing is the fastest in the world (when used with an EOS-3)  thanks to a ring USM and improved drive algorithm. Closest focusing distance has been reduced to 2.5m  while operatibility has been substantially improved by full time mechanical manual focus  improved focus preset  and the introduction of an AF Stop function.

8796232581121,8X25 IS,8X25 IS,Just 12 cm wide and weighing only 490g. the new 8x25 IS binoculars are the most compact and lightweight IS binoculars Canon has ever developed.<br/><br/>- Compact  lightweight design<br/>- Tilt Mechanism Image Stabiliser<br/>- 8x magnification power<br/>- Rounded shape<br/>- Field flattener lens<br/>- Simple and convenient to use<br/>- Battery allows 6 hours of continuous operation<br/>- Centrally mounted controls.<br/><br/>Canon's smallest and lightest IS Binoculars<br/><br/>The new IS binoculars have an appealing rounded shaped design for more comfortable handling. They owe their small size  low weight and superb image-stabilising ability to the latest in Image Stabilisation technology: the Tilt Mechanism. This mechanism keeps your subject steady by correcting movements  such as hand shake. Battery power is minimised because the IS optics only uses power when the IS button is pressed. Like the focusing knob  this button is centrally located on the binoculars  easily reachable by both left and right handed users. As a further refinement  the tilt-system Image Stabiliser of the 8x25 IS suppresses chromatic aberrations and reduces colour ‘smearing’ in order to keep your image clear. Being environmentally conscious Canon have used lead-free glass in the new IS binoculars.,26095309,/Open-Catalogue/Binoculars/8X25-IS/p/1209761,MIRACLE_001,,8796132180110,347.46,,,,/300Wx300H/1209761-651.jpg,,,,0013803010572,,,,,electro,Canon,,7562A019AA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8796131360910:8796132180110,Open Catalogue|Binoculars,/Open-Catalogue/c/1|/Open-Catalogue/Binoculars/c/1421,,490.0,,USD

8796230582273,NV10,The NV10 comes in an 18.5mm thin black aluminium body with Samsung's unique blue ring on its extendable lens barrel  and a pop-up flash.,<b>10.1 mega-pixel 1/1.8""CCD high resolution</b><br/>The NV10 comes in an 18.5mm thin black aluminium body with Samsung's unique blue ring on its expendable lens barrel  and a pop-up flash. A 10.1 mega pixels  1/1.8"" CCD  not normally used in slim cameras  is used to give better detail.<br/><br/><b>Smart Touch + Large 2.5"" LCD</b><br/>The new Smart Touch user interface makes it possible to quickly navigate and set menu items or view pictures. The unique makeup of the Smart Touch buttons with large 2.5 inch LCD on the back of the camera is expected to be great fun for users  giving them an experience unlike anything they have tried before.<br/><br/><b>The superior Schneider-KREUZNACH lens</b><br/>The superior Schneider-KREUZNACH lens produces crystal clear images. <br/>Bright lens that start at f2.8 delivers even resolution from the centre to the edges. For more natural-looking pictures  each lens surface is multi-coated to minimize the ""ghost"" or ""flare"" phenomenon.<br/><br/><b>Pop-Up Flash</b><br/>The most distinctive feature of the new NV Series is the built-in pop-up flash. The use of a pop-up mechanism made the overall design simple yet luxurious  and its location  right above the lens  hugely improved light diffusion angles and transmission rates. The lens location is also ideal for delivering the flashlight as intended  since it prevents accidental blocking of the flash by a hand.<br/><br/><b>Advanced Shake Reduction</b><br/>The ASR technology prevents the degradation of image clarity and colour common to flash photography. With ASR the effects of camera shake are reduced in lower light conditions. You can even take well exposed  sharper pictures in low light without using a flash at all. It guarantees brighter and more natural pictures.<br/><br/><b>ISO1000 Standards in Action</b><br/>NV series has an auto sensitivity feature that automatically adjusts sensitivity according to the ambient exposure conditions up to ISO 1000. The high sensitivity setting of ISO 1000 enables you to take clear indoor pictures in the dark without camera shake and the resulting image blurring.<br/><br/><b>Photo Gallery function</b><br/>This is an upgraded version of the photo album  which used to let you access the Menu only from Play Back. Now  this new UI lets you go directly to the album. Pictures are grouped and stored by date for easier access.<br/><br/><b>Multiple ways to Recharge</b><br/>Recharging can be done using a cradle or a 24 pin USB cable  as well as by using a detachable cable. Connect the camera to a PC using a 24 pin USB cable  use the adaptor cable to plug it into a power supply  or use any other convenient method to recharge your camera. <br/><br/><b>Advanced Movie Function</b><br/>The NV series supports MPEG-4 VGA (640x480  30fps) and TVD (720x480  20fps - NV3) size for an enhanced video shooting experience. You can even edit your movies on the camera itself  making these clever models brilliantly portable but powerful movie-makers.<br/><br/><b>Scene Mode</b><br/>11 Scene Modes and Text Recognition capability NV series have various scene modes to obtain the best picture result in a variety of settings.<br/>The scene modes provided are Night Scene  Portrait  Children  Landscape  Text Recognition  Sunset  Dawn  Backlight  Fireworks  Beach and Snow.,26095309,/Open-Catalogue/Cameras/Digital-Cameras/Digital-Compacts/NV10/p/553637,MIRACLE_001,,8796131557518,264.69,,mm,,/300Wx300H/553637-934.jpg,,,,8801089775528,,,,,electro,Samsung,,NV10,,60.0,96.5,18.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8796131360910:8796131459214:8796131524750:8796131557518,Open Catalogue|Cameras|Digital Cameras|Digital Compacts,/Open-Catalogue/c/1|/Open-Catalogue/Cameras/c/571|/Open-Catalogue/Cameras/Digital-Cameras/c/575|/Open-Catalogue/Cameras/Digital-Cameras/Digital-Compacts/c/576,,148.7,,USD
